# Notion Pretty Links 💅

Turning Notion's random path blarb to actual readable characters.

## How it Works 🩰

1. Grab the path that you want to replace.
2. Open up the extension.
3. Paste the path in the in the "Path to Replace" input box.
4. Type the path you want to see instead of it in "New Path".
5. Click the submit button and you're set. Remove it by finding it in the list of custom paths and click x.

## Architecture 📐

### Storage 💾

-   To store the paths I utilize Google Chrome's [chrome.storage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage).

## Technologies 🧺

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Todo ☑️

-   Do the thing we want to do: replace a path that we added (put old path and new path)
-   Update list without having to refresh
-   Fix the ugly code in PathItem for object
-   Fix styles, especially for PathItem
-   Make a copy current path (copies path of current page and adds to replaced path)
-   Make a clear button
-   Write a clear diagram of how this works
